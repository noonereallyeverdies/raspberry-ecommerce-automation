    "i want to build out an optimized setup for raspberry pi 4 gb with 128 gb drive or we could use our 2 gb external ssd instead. we want it to be a productivity powerhouse and well integrated with our current setup or optimized with open sourced tools and self hosted properly. research the best practices or search for the best thing for the plan here for all of these ideas. maybe considering something like hosting ai agents through n8n or something similar to take note of",
    "i would prefer using ai agent workflow and automation but if not, i would be fine with a personal cloud storage and file sync",
    "i run an ecommerce website and want to optimize properly to have me run the social media and have the ai draft and create and send everything for the brand and is in control of content creation and management for it. i also like to have data collection and moitoring where we save all of the emails from this brand i like to train the llm so that we can make similar emails for our own brand. i definitely also do want to have a personal assistant automation run everything properly with calendar management, tasks, and reminders. also to save and track properly so that the ai agent can essentially ebcome an accountant and properly track and follow things effectively for the business. lets have this automation focus completely well for the business",
    "shopify, we want to focus on instagram but build out our facebook and tiktok and possibly linkedin but we are unsure of it. we have a titan email. we will use spreadsheets and look for open suorced accounting software for the business. we can use and centralize ever tasks on our local google workspace or apple setup using appscripts for the project, we will use google analytics, microsoft clarity, meta pixel to improve our data interpratation",
    "1 want to post 3 times/day on instagram to begin testing and improving and have updates on stories frequently especially every hour to see what works well and what does not and be able to track and log that data properly to use that insight to improve the setup. i just have a catalog of around 50-100 emails to learn from. right now very small like 10 but we want to build and scale. also we will be running automations to reach out and scale with local salons and small businesses in the area to have more avenues of inventory. we do not have much historic data yet but we want to optimize and build with the intention of having it run as autonomously as possible so that a few people could run the business. we can keep it down an hour a day at most. data should be backed up at least every two days but it should vary to what is logical given the amount of files that needs to be backed up. ",
    "we should be able to have access to it if needed . we will not have other users just yet, we will let them edit though if needed and we can see who did what possibly to track changes accordingly. since we are self hosting, provide the good proactive measures to keep everything stored safely without making it too complicated. yes we will have human approval on telegram though after a certain confidence threshold, it should be able to send things out on their own. we should have an ai agent specifically for quality assurance though. whatever teh best practices are for this specific setup. we will store backups locally ",
    "i do not need to use local llm since this is such a small computer, we will use gemini for now, so please create and push this git repo please",
    "be highly critical of the following plan and research and build on the best exisiting practices to map out the workflow and improve on the big picture plan here with better understanding of the refinements on all of the small picture details to take note of for the rest of the project here"
