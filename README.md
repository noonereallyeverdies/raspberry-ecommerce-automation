# Raspberry Pi E-commerce Business Automation System

A lightweight, AI-powered automation platform running on Raspberry Pi 4 that handles social media management, customer communications, and business operations for e-commerce stores - now with **Appwrite Cloud** for maximum simplicity.

## 🚀 What's New: Appwrite Cloud Changes Everything

We're now using **Appwrite Cloud** instead of self-hosting, which means:
- **90% less resource usage** on the Pi (no database or backend services needed)
- **Zero database maintenance** (Appwrite handles everything)
- **Instant setup** (no Appwrite installation required)
- **Free tier** covers most small businesses
- **Automatic backups and scaling** included

## Overview

This system transforms a $75 Raspberry Pi 4 into a powerful business automation hub that manages your entire e-commerce operation autonomously. By leveraging Appwrite Cloud for backend services, the Pi focuses solely on workflow automation and API orchestration.

## 📋 Architecture Evolution

### Version 1: Original (Overly Ambitious)
- Self-hosted everything on Pi → **Failed: 4GB RAM insufficient**

### Version 2: Distributed (Complex)
- Pi + External VPS → **Better but expensive and complex**

### Version 3: Appwrite Self-Hosted (Good)
- Single Appwrite instance → **Simplified but still resource heavy**

### Version 4: Appwrite Cloud (BEST) ✅
- **Pi handles**: n8n workflows, rate limiting, scheduling
- **Appwrite Cloud handles**: Database, auth, storage, functions, realtime
- **Result**: Ultra-lightweight, reliable, scalable

## 🎯 Key Features

- **Social Media Automation**: AI-generated content for Instagram (3x daily), Facebook, TikTok
- **Smart Rate Limiting**: Respects Instagram's 200 req/hr limit, prevents API bans
- **Email Intelligence**: Learns from your emails to generate contextual responses
- **B2B Outreach**: Automated campaigns to local salons and businesses
- **Quality Assurance**: AI confidence scoring with Telegram approval workflow
- **Business Intelligence**: Real-time metrics, automated accounting, inventory tracking
- **Multi-Profile Support**: Separate business and personal automation modes

## 💻 Tech Stack

### On Raspberry Pi 4 (Minimal)
- **OS**: Ubuntu Server 22.04 ARM64 (64-bit required)
- **Automation**: n8n (workflows only)
- **Queue**: Redis (lightweight caching)
- **Monitoring**: Basic health checks

### Cloud Services
- **Backend**: Appwrite Cloud (FREE tier)
- **AI**: Gemini API ($15-30/month with batch mode)
- **E-commerce**: Shopify webhooks
- **Social**: Instagram, Facebook, TikTok APIs
- **Messaging**: Telegram Bot

## 💰 Cost Breakdown

```
Monthly Costs:
- Raspberry Pi electricity: $3-5
- Appwrite Cloud: $0 (free tier) or $15 (pro)
- Gemini API: $15-30 (with batch optimization)
- Total: $18-50/month

Compare to alternatives:
- Hootsuite + Mailchimp + QuickBooks: $200+/month
- Custom development: $5,000+ upfront
- Full-time VA: $2,000+/month
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Raspberry Pi 4 (8GB recommended, 4GB minimum)
- 128GB+ SSD via USB 3.0
- Ubuntu Server 22.04 ARM64 (NOT Raspberry Pi OS)
- Appwrite Cloud account (free)
- Shopify store
- Instagram Business account

### Setup Steps

1. **Create Appwrite Cloud Project** (5 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Sign up at https://cloud.appwrite.io
   # Create new project
   # Copy Project ID and API Key
   ```

2. **Prepare Your Pi** (30 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Flash Ubuntu 22.04 ARM64 to SSD
   # Boot Pi and SSH in
   ssh ubuntu@raspberrypi.local
   
   # Install Docker
   curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
   sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
   ```

3. **Deploy Automation Stack** (15 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Clone this repo
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raspberry-automation
   cd raspberry-automation
   
   # Configure environment
   cp .env.example .env
   nano .env  # Add your Appwrite Cloud credentials
   
   # Start services
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access Your System**
   - n8n: `http://raspberrypi.local:5678`
   - Monitoring: `http://raspberrypi.local:3000`
   - Appwrite: `https://cloud.appwrite.io/console`

## 🔄 Development Workflow

**Important**: Never develop directly on the Pi!

1. **Develop on your Mac/PC** using Docker Desktop
2. **Test locally** with mock data
3. **Push to GitHub** for version control
4. **Deploy to Pi** via git pull and restart

See [development-setup.md](development-setup.md) for detailed guide.
