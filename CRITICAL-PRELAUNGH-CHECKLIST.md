## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL BLOCKERS - Fix These First!

```yaml
MUST HAVE:

- Facebook Page linked to Instagram
- Meta Business Suite access
- Instagram Graph API access approved

## FINAL WARNINGS

1. **Instagram API is fragile** - One wrong move = banned
2. **Costs can spiral** - Monitor API usage daily
3. **Backups are critical** - Automate from day 1
4. **Start small** - 1 post/day first week
5. **Human review required** - Never 100% automate

Remember: This is a marathon, not a sprint. Start with basic automation and add complexity gradually!
